# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This is an analysis of PyBer ride share service. I will dive into the difference in ride share revenue between different city types and when the fares increase during which times of the year.

## Results
There are six major ways that I am going to breakdown the differences for Pybers ride share revenue:
	1.) City Type 
	2.) Total Rides
	3.) Total Drivers
	4.) Total Fares
	5.) Average Fare per Rides
	7.) Average Fare per Driver
Using these 6 categories, I can breakdown and see which categories are popular and where there are disparities between each city type.
Take a look at the photo below and see the breakdown for each city type:
