# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Let's take look at the differences in Pyber's ride sharing data to see what are the major differences in rides for different city types.

## Results
There are six major ways that I am going to breakdown the differences for Pybers ride share revenue:

	1.) City Type 
	2.) Total Rides
	3.) Total Drivers
	4.) Total Fares
	5.) Average Fare per Rides
	7.) Average Fare per Driver

Using these 6 categories, I can breakdown and see which categories are popular and where there are disparities between each city type.

Take a look at the photo below and see the breakdown for each city type:

Also lets a look at an overview for total fare by city type for a 4 month time period.

### Suburban Cities
According to the photo above, in suburban cities there are a total of 8,570 drivers, but only 625 rides were given. The total amount of fares taken in was $19,356.33 with an average of around $30.97 per ride. Since there are 8,570 drivers that amounts to around $2.26 received per driver. This data is showing that for suburban cities there are a lot more drivers compared to the amount of people looking for a ride. Why is that? One possible reason is that suburban areas are not known to have a lot of public transportation services so it would be a good assumption that most people that live in the suburd owns a vehicle. Since they own a vehicle there is less of a demand for rides there.

### Urban Cities
As we move onto Urban Cities we see that the data there is different compared to suburban cities. Lets take a closer look. Again, referencing the photo in the results section the data is showing that there are significantly more drivers, but at the same time the amount of riders did not increase substantially compared to the suburban cities. Specifically, there are 59,602 drivers in Urban Cities but only 1,625 rides were taken. The total amount of fares collected by the drivers amounts to $39,854.38 with the average fare per ride being $24.53. The average fare is decreased compared to suburban cities which makes sense because the amount of drivers in Urban Cities is a 149% increase compared to Suburban Cities. This difference leads to a significant drop in driver fare revenue with each driver collecting around $0.67 compared to the $2.26 in Suburban Cities. 

The gigantic increase in drivers compared to Suburban Cities is logical. Since Urban Cities most likely will have a robust public transportation system there would be less of a demand for rides. At the same time since Urban Cities are more likely to have a higher population density compared to Suburban Cities it wouldn't be far-fetched to say that public transportation would be crowded as well. This situation should lead to more rides being taken by the urban population. 

### Rural Cities
For Rural Cities as before lets reference the photo above under the Results section. Taking a look, Rural Cities seem to have the largest difference compared to Urban and Suburban Cities. In Rural Cities there are 537 drivers who collectively gave 125 rides total. The total fares collected by these drivers amount to $4,327.93 with the average fare being $34.62. This leads to the average fare per driver being $8.06. Just looking at the total drivers and rides gives it is a significant difference compared to Urban and Suburban Cities by a large margin. There is some good news if you are a driver in Rural Cities. Your average fare is around 112% greater compared to suburban drivers and 169% greater compared to urban drivers. Rural drivers earn significanlty more compared to the other two city types, but the downside is that as a driver you are not giving out that many rides therefore your earning are much lower.

## Recommendations for Improvment
There is clearly room for improvement with Pyber ride services particurlarly in the the Urban and Suburban markets. So lets take a look at some ways that can be used to generate additional reveneu for Pyber.

### Entice More First Time Riders
One way that Pyber can generate more rides per driver in suburban and urban cities is to offer in-app more deals or coupons which riders can take advantage of. Espescially coupons for first time riders. There are a lot of drivers in both of these city types but much fewer riders comparatively. By offering coupons for first time riders, Pyber can entice riders to try the service for the first time and they can really get a feel for the service it provides. Espescially in the Urban market. Since public transportation will be crowded in Urban Cities it would make sense that people would prefer to not take public transport and resort to alternative. By getting these people to try the service they may be willing in the future to use it again.

### Decrease the amount of drivers
Another way to increase the fares earned by drivers is to decrease the amount of drivers. Particularly in the Suburban and Urban Cities. While it makes sense that there are a lot of drivers for both of these markets it would seem that there are a lot more drivers compared to rider. Now decreasing the amount of drivers may seem negative upon first hearing it but lets decrease the amount in a different manner. One way would be to create subdivision within the driver catagory by the type of car they drive such as regular sedans or luxury vehicles. This can assist in increasing the amount of revenue earned since luxury vehicles can charge a higher fare and some riders may be willing to pay a premium to ride in a luxury vehicle.

### More Promotion to some existing riders
The third way to increase fares and address the disparity between riders and drives is to offer promotions to existing users. While offering these promotions may lead initially to a decrease in fares for both the company and the driver it can serve to make the rider more used to using the service and more inclined in the future to continue using the service. So these promotions should not be targetted at power users of the service but more the riders that only use the service occassionally or only a few times.
